                <h3>What is coffee?</h3>
                <p>
                    &#9;Coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from the roasted or baked seeds of several species of an evergreen shrub of the genus Coffea. 
                    The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded Coffea arabica, and the "robusta" form of the hardier Coffea canephora. 
                    The latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix), but has a more bitter taste. 
                    Coffee plants are cultivated in more than 70 countries, primarily in equatorial Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. 
                    Once ripe, coffee "berries" are picked, processed and dried to yield the seeds inside. 
                    The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.

                    <p>
                        Best coffee in Vermont so far. I had the hazelnut iced latte on a hot day and it was simply delicious. 
                        Coconut macaroon was also delectable. Maglianero offers a wide range of pastries, coffees and teas. 
                        I also discovered an amazing sparkling water, Saratoga.
                        <br>
                        Laid-back ambiance, modern / loft architecture and good music are just perfect. 
                        You can even park your bike inside the coffee shop.

                <p>
                    It's the atmosphere of Muddy Waters that really makes this coffee shop unique. If walking into a warm, wood cabin makes you feel good, you will undoubtedly love the aura of this place.

                <p>
                    Have a craving for quality coffee or fruit/vegetable juices?  Look no further: Muddy Waters has it. They even have beer on tap. That's pretty awesome. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The staff members are friendly and down-to-earth. You won't likely find an unkind person working here.

                    Beautiful cafe with friendly and patient service. The exposed brick and garage type doors add to the comfortable atmosphere. I had a delicious cup of espresso.
